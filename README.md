# Battleships.Simple
Simple game of battleships against the computer as a console app.

Currently its just a console app with the models for the game 
fleshed out so that they have some behaviour that we can pick up if we want to ad a UI (view) later.

Only a single player against the computer is allowed at the moment but the design shouldnt stop 
addition of further strategies to make it less dumb (its random shooting atm) and should take into account
whats left on the board to shoot at and work out nearest neighbours to existing hits !
